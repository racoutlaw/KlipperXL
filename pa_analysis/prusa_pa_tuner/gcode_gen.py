"""Generate the K-sweep test G-code for the PA tuning run.

The job:
  1. Configure UDP target (M334) and enable loadcell metric (M331 probe_load_line).
  2. Home, heat, park at a user-defined purge position above the bed.
  3. For each K in the sweep:
        - M572 S<value>             (set Pressure Advance -- Prusa-specific;
                                     Buddy/Core One does NOT honour Marlin's
                                     M900 K, it silently no-ops)
        - M117 PA_K=<value>          (visible marker, also useful to spot in serial log)
        - emit a uniquely-tagged comment that the runner uses to slice the timeseries
        - extrude a square wave of cycles_per_K cycles, each cycle = slow burst + fast burst
        - small retract + dwell to settle
  4. Stop streaming and cool down.

Notes:
  - Prusa Buddy / Core One uses M572 S<value> for Pressure Advance, where
    the value is in seconds (advance time, equivalent to Klipper's PA).
    Typical PLA values fall in 0.00..0.10. We sweep this range by default.
    Note: Marlin's M900 K is NOT supported on Prusa Buddy -- see
    https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusa-firmware-specific-g-code-commands_112173
  - Extrusion velocities are in mm/s of *filament feed* (not toolhead motion).
    Snapmaker U1 defaults: slow=0.8 mm/s, fast=8 mm/s. We mirror those.
  - The runner relies on the comment markers `;PA_TUNER K_START=<k>` and
    `;PA_TUNER K_END=<k>` plus the matching wall-clock arrival of the next packets
    after the printer parses them. Those comments don't generate motion so they're
    effectively free, but Buddy doesn't echo comments to UDP — sync via M117 echo
    or the `sdpos` metric is more robust. The runner times segments using the
    plan's `K_segments` schedule (start_time, duration) returned alongside the gcode.

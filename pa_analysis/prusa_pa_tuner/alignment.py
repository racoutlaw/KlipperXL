"""Sweep-t0 anchoring and per-K window slicing.

Extracted verbatim from `analysis.py` (which re-exports these names for
backwards compatibility). This module owns everything that decides WHERE
the sweep is in the captured timeseries:

* burst-onset detectors (`_detect_sweep_start`, `_detect_first_pos_motion`,
  `_detect_z_marker_anchor`),
* cycle-boundary detectors (`_detect_pos_cycle_starts`,
  `_detect_pos_transitions`, `_detect_force_cycle_starts`),
* per-K window slicers (`_anchor_and_slice_from_pos`,
  `_slice_from_force_cycles`, `_slice_from_plan`,
  `_slice_from_pos_transitions`, `_slice_from_pos_with_known_anchor`),
* and `resolve_anchor_and_windows`, the precedence cascade that combines
  them into a single (sweep_t0, windows) resolution for `analyse_sweep`.

The allowed dependency direction is `analysis -> alignment`; this module
must never import from `analysis`.

    """Find the wall-clock time the burst pattern actually begins.

    The runner's `sweep_t0` is set to the first UDP packet after job upload,
    but the printer spends 30-60+ s heating/homing/priming before the first
    burst. Using that t0 puts every per-K window inside the heatup phase
    and analysis returns NaN.

    Two-stage detection:

    1. **Coarse** -- rolling std over one cycle period. Threshold is
       relative to the GLOBAL MAX of stds (`0.25 · max_std`), not to
       the median of an arbitrary "head" window. Bursts produce std
       far larger than any pre-burst transient (homing, heating-element
       click, fan ramp-up); pegging the threshold to the run's own peak
       cleanly separates the burst region from everything before it.
       Then we require the threshold to be sustained for at least
       `min_sustain_cycles` cycles -- this rejects short loud spikes
       (loadcell tap, single mechanical event) that happen to exceed
       the threshold.

       The previous implementation pegged the threshold to "median of
       the first 25% of stds + 8·MAD", which is fooled when pre-burst
       noise (e.g. the user's case: M109-park motion at t≈22 s with
       loadcell std 130) lands inside the "head" window and pushes the
       baseline up so the burst region never registers as a clear
       outlier. Worse, the homing transient itself can exceed the
       threshold and the detector returns a t somewhere in the homing
       phase. Run inspection on the user's NPZ showed this returning
       t=7 s when the actual bursts start at t=100 s.

    2. **Fine** -- cross-correlate the (detrended) force trace against
       a model square wave, restricted to a narrow ±2-cycle window
       around the coarse estimate. The argmax there is the K=0 burst
       start, accurate to a sample.

    Sub-cycle precision matters: the per-K phase-lag fitter searches over
    ±1 s, so a `t0` error larger than one cycle aliases the lag estimate
    to the search-window boundary and the fit becomes meaningless.

    Each sweep cycle is `slow leg (X ramps up) + fast leg (X ramps down)`,

    fast, ~zero during inter-burst settling. A cycle starts where the
    sign of velocity transitions from non-positive (settled or fast-leg-
    ending) to positive.

    Implementation: smooth the velocity with a ~100 ms moving average
    (removes sample-grid jitter), bucket each sample as +1/0/−1 around a
    `quiet_frac · peak_velocity` deadband, and emit a timestamp every
    time the sign transitions from {−1, 0} to +1. The deadband prevents
    noise during settled periods from masquerading as a cycle start, but
    we deliberately allow the FIRST positive sample after the initial
    quiet (sign 0 → +1) to count -- otherwise we'd lose cycle[0] of every
    burst sequence because the detector never saw a -1 before it.

    Asymmetric slow/fast legs work: even when peak fast-leg velocity is
    4× peak slow-leg velocity, the slow ramp still clears `quiet_frac ·

    STICKY sign-of-delta algorithm — the same logic the live preview's
    JavaScript uses and that produces a clean square wave even when
    pos_x is firmware-quantized in coarse steps.

    Returns (times, directions) where:

      * direction +1 = pos_x reversed from increasing to decreasing, i.e.
        a peak. In the sweep gcode the slow leg moves X from x_base to
        x_base+dx (X increasing) and the fast leg returns (X decreasing),
        so a peak is the slow→fast transition in E (commanded velocity
        rising). Matches `_integral_area`'s "above crossings" convention.
      * direction −1 = pos_x reversed from decreasing to increasing, i.e.
        a trough = fast→slow transition = E velocity falling.

    Why sticky-delta instead of smoothed-velocity sign-flips:

    Buddy reports pos_x at ~56-80 Hz with a quantization step around
    0.05-0.1 mm. With coupled_dx_mm=1 and fast_half_s=0.8 s, the
    fast-leg velocity is ~1.25 mm/s, so the position advances ~22 µm
    between consecutive pos samples — BELOW the firmware's reporting
    resolution. The firmware emits stair-stepped pos_x: many samples
    at one value, then a sudden jump. `np.gradient` on this produces
    huge velocity spikes alternating with zero plateaus, and any
    smoothed-velocity sign-detector fires repeatedly inside one real
    leg (observed: 6 transitions in 0.84 s of what should be one
    fast leg on the user's 2026-05 NPZ).

    The sticky-delta approach is robust to quantization. We compute
    `delta = pos_x[i] − last_committed_x`. As long as delta stays
    inside ±deadband, the direction is held. Once |delta| ≥ deadband,
    the sign of delta becomes the new committed direction, and
    last_committed_x is updated. A real transition is emitted only on
    a sign change of the committed direction.

    `deadband_frac` is fraction of the observed pos_x oscillation
    amplitude (default 20%). Auto-discovered from `np.percentile(pos_x,
    95) − np.percentile(pos_x, 5)`, with a 0.02 mm minimum so a
    nearly-static pos_x doesn't fire on encoder dither.

    The burst signal has a long slow plateau and a brief fast plateau,

    timestamp per cycle -- far more reliable than pos_x cycle
    detection, which on this firmware's 56 Hz pos throttle picks up
    sub-cycle features as false positives and misses real cycles
    when X amplitude is small.

    Implementation:
      * Slice the trace to [t_lo, t_hi] (default: full range). The
        caller usually passes the burst region from
        `_detect_sweep_start` so the percentile-based threshold isn't
        skewed by pre-burst noise.
      * Auto-discover plateau levels from the 10th and 90th
        percentiles of the windowed force.
      * Threshold = midpoint between plateaus.
      * Emit one timestamp per rising-edge crossing.
      * Merge edges closer than `min_gap_s` (defensive against
        loadcell ringing right after the transition crossing the
        threshold a second time).

    The G-code generator is the ground truth for the sweep schedule. It
    knows the per-segment start times relative to `sweep_t0` AND it
    encodes any non-uniform cycle behaviour (e.g. K[0] cycle 0 is
    `warmup_factor × slow_half + fast_half` long instead of the usual
    `slow_half + fast_half`, so the very first segment can be 11 s while
    every later K is 3 s). Slicing directly from `seg.start_offset_s`
    and `seg.duration_s` therefore handles warm-up, accel ramps, and
    any future per-segment quirks without needing the analyser to
    rediscover them from edge detection.

    This is the preferred slicer whenever we have a trusted anchor (the
    Z-marker pulse is unambiguous when emitted). Force/pos_x edge

    pos_x is the most reliable cycle-boundary signal we have:
      * Each commanded cycle drives the toolhead a known `coupled_d*_mm`
        away from purge and back. The sign-of-delta detector emits one
        +1 (slow→fast = X reverses from rising to falling) and one -1
        (fast→slow = X reverses from falling to rising) per cycle.
      * The transitions are physically guaranteed -- the toolhead
        actually moved -- so unlike force-trace threshold crossings they
        don't fail under purge spikes or under-amplified plateaus.
      * They land at the actual cycle moment regardless of any firmware
        processing delay between gcode parse and motion execution.

    The third point is why this slicer is preferred over plan-direct
    slicing whenever pos_x oscillation is available: on the user's
    run_1779100636 the gap between Z-marker DOWN (the supposed sweep_t0)
    and the FIRST pos_x +1 transition was ~2.3 s longer than the

    G1-with-XYZ planner-sync took ~2.3 s the plan can't see. Plan-
    direct slicing put every K window 2.3 s before the data; pos_x-
    transition slicing puts them on the data.

    Algorithm (DATA-DRIVEN for K[0], plan-driven for K[1..]):
      1. Detect all pos_x transitions via `_detect_pos_transitions`.
      2. Strip leading -1s that come BEFORE the first +1 (those are
         pre-burst rebounds, not real cycles).
      3. Require at least `2 × total_cycles` transitions remaining,
         alternating (+1, -1).
      4. K[0]'s first slow leg start is detected from the DATA, not the
         plan: scan pos_x backwards from the first +1 transition for
         the latest time pos_x sat within `0.5·amplitude` of the pre-
         burst baseline. That instant is when the toolhead actually
         started moving. We use this instead of inverting
         `K[0].duration_s` because the plan's `first_slow_leg_factor`
         may be wrong on replay (NPZ dumps did not store it), and the
         data is always authoritative.
      5. For each K[i]:
         * t_lo: start of K[i] cycle 0's slow leg. i=0 → detected K[0]
           motion start from step 4. i>0 → -1 transition of K[i-1]'s
           last cycle (slow leg of K[i] starts where K[i-1] ended).
         * t_hi: -1 transition of K[i]'s last cycle.
      6. Refine sweep_t0 from K[0]'s detected slow leg start:
         `refined_t0 = K[0]_slow_start - K[0].start_offset_s`.

    Returns `(windows, refined_sweep_t0)` on success, `None` on any

    The gcode generator emits a unique-signature Z motion immediately
    before the first burst: lift the toolhead by `expected_lift_mm`,
    brief dwell, drop back. Nothing else in the run produces a Z
    excursion of this magnitude, so a single bump in pos_z anchored to
    its return-to-baseline gives us an unambiguous sweep_t0 — far more
    robust than periodicity-based cycle-start detection on a noisy
    pos_x trace where park motions, planner-lookahead jitter, and the
    bursts themselves all look superficially similar.

    Detection:

    1. Auto-discover the resting Z baseline from the first ~1 s of pos_z
       (median is robust to a few outliers).
    2. Walk forward; find the first sample where pos_z exceeds
       `baseline + 0.5·expected_lift_mm` (toolhead has clearly lifted).
    3. From there, find the first sample where pos_z is back within
       `0.3·expected_lift_mm` of the baseline. Linearly interpolate the
       threshold crossing for sub-sample precision.

    Two false-positive gates (user's flow_1784020430, 2026-07-14:
    homing PROBE TAPS — a slow ~1.7 mm descent, quick pop back up,
    descend again — matched the lift+return signature almost exactly
    and anchored the sweep 59 s early, before the heater even
    finished):

    * **Baseline gate** — the marker is always emitted at the purge
      height. When the caller knows it (`expected_base_z_mm`,
      = plan purge_z), candidates whose local baseline is more than
      1 mm away are rejected outright. Probe taps happen near Z≈0
      / negative; the purge sits at 50-80 mm.
    * **Post-return settle gate** — after the marker's Z-down the
      toolhead DWELLS at the purge height (pre-roll / tare hold), so
      pos_z must stay near baseline for ~1 s after the return. Probe
      taps immediately descend again and fail this.

    Returns the host-clock timestamp of the return, or None when no
    Z bump of the expected magnitude is found (older gcode without
    the marker, or pos_z metric not enabled).
